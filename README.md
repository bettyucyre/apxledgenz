<h2 id="maybe-you-are-hwid-banned-">Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️</h2>
<p>Did your ban hit you right after making a fresh account, or is it following you across multiple accounts like a clingy teammate? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! That means Apex Legends has tagged your PC hardware as naughty, so even new accounts aren’t safe.</p>
